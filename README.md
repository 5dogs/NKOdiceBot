NKOdiceBot is "Dice Game account" working on Twitter.
<br>Everyone can PLAY it.

# Why I made this bot
* For **all Japanese leaner**
* For practicing Javascript
* For dealing with Twitter API

# How to play
1. Mention "@NKOdiceBot roll a dice" or "@NKOdiceBot ダイスをふる" to this account
2. You will get reply randam Japanese words with 5(or less) charactors 
3. You also get score based on the words

# what charactors be chosen
Charactors will be picked up from [う,ま,ち,ん,こ,お].
<br>Each letter is pronounced [U, MA, CHI, NN, KO].
<br>Sometimes dice fall off of table so dice doesn't always return 5.
